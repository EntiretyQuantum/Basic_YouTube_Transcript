This Python script utilizes the `youtube_transcript_api` library to retrieve and save the transcript of a specified YouTube video. It consists of two functions: `get_youtube_transcript` for fetching the transcript and `save_transcript` for storing it in a text file. The main section of the script retrieves the transcript for a specific video ID, saves it to a file, and prints a success message. This script is ideal for automating the extraction of YouTube video transcripts for analysis or reference.
